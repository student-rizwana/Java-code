📌 Description

This Java program demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including:

- Variables and Data Types  
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)  
- Loops (for, while, do-while)  
- Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical)

It is designed for beginners to understand the core building blocks of Java through simple and clear examples.
